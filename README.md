# just playing with selenium to try to bruteforce something

> ### "okay but why the fuck do that are you stupid??"

so i was trying to bruteforce my teacher's site so i don't have to pay him for codes
and stuff and the other ways didn't work like requests and hydra and stuff like that
so i thought lemme just automate my browser so like yeah i did it but it didn't work because the codes are too random
the codes required an 8 character string with numbers optional, so i autogenerated like 11k of them but i realized it's just a waste of internet bandwidth so yeah
but hypothetically it works!!!!!!!!

> ### how to run!!!!!!

okay uhhh so just run generateythingy.py to generate the list
and then import your browser path i was using brave so i added the path to brave's exe
then find the name of the element of the input place and change the

```py
browser.find_element_by_name('element name here sdpofgise09sd;fklwr')
```

and the submitting button too so it autoclicks on it

## idk why i did this it just looked sick in my sugar and sleep deprived head + i just finally found a cool theme for vscode and it makes coding satisfying :D so don't blame me if the code is bad or yk what? blame me idc uwu
